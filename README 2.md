# Cryptosite

Purpose: I made a website that automatically updates the prices of different cryptos.

-I am the most proud of my home page that displays the current coin price and how the mouse switches to the hand when the mouse hovers over the menu.

-If I had more time, I would figure out how to make the coin prices change live without a delay.
-I would also make it so I can fetch specific coin names from the api to just display that coin.
